# native-swift-MNIST

I want to start getting some experience working with Swift as a data science language, and am starting with the goal of creating a neural network from scratch and training it using the MNIST data set. Once it works, I plan on parallelizing it through the Metal API and accelerate frameworks.

You can reach me currently at tyz001@students.jefferson.edu if you need to reach me. Let's make Swift the Science Standard!
